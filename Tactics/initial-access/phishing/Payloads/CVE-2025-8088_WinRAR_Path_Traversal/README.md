# CVE-2025-8088 RAR Path Traversal Exploit Builder

This Python script automates the creation of a malicious RAR archive that exploits a path traversal vulnerability.

### Requirements

- On Host:
	- Python 3.x
	- WinRAR (`rar.exe`) installed and available in the system's PATH.

- On Target:
	- WinRAR version <= 7.12

### Usage
The script takes one argument: the path to a legitimate file that will be used as a visual decoy inside the archive.

```bash
python exploit_builder.py "C:\path\to\your\decoy-document.pdf"
```

### Description

The script will:

1. Create a carrier file (metadata.txt).
2. Attach multiple Alternate Data Streams (ADS) to the carrier, each containing a payload with a different path traversal depth.
3. Archive both your decoy document and the weaponized carrier into a final exploit.rar.

For the full TTP description, see `RAR_Path_Traversal.md`.
