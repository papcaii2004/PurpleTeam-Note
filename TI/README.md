# Threat Intelligence

## What is CTI

Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is evidence-based knowledge that helps us to:

- Understand a cyber attacker's attack behavior and motives.
- Predict the attackersâ€™ next attack targets.

There are three types of CTI:

- Strategic
  - Purpose: Provides a high-level overview of the threat landscape, focusing on trends, motivations, and the overall impact of cyber threats on the organization. It helps in understanding the "who" and "why" behind attacks.

  - Audience: Executive management, board members, and other high-level decision-makers.

  - Characteristics:

    - Non-technical, focusing on business risks and implications.

    - Broad in scope, covering long-term trends and emerging threats.

    - Often presented in reports, briefings, and presentations.

    - Helps in making strategic decisions about security investments, resource allocation, and risk management.

  - Examples:

    - Reports on the overall threat landscape for a particular industry.

    - Analysis of the motivations and goals of major threat actor groups.

    - Assessments of the potential impact of cyber threats on business operations.

    - Geopolitical factors influencing the cyber threat environment.
